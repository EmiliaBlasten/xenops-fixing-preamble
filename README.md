Xenops is a LaTeX editing environment for Emacs.

- Inline preview of LaTeX math content as SVG with automatic re-rendering.
- Automatic unicode math replacements.
- Opinionated visual alterations to LaTeX markup.

Xenops is built on top of LaTeX editing features already present in Emacs ([auctex](https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/) and [org-mode](https://orgmode.org/manual/Previewing-LaTeX-fragments.html)).
